Soeren by Shel Silverstein



Soeren loves me,

Soeren cares,

Soeren picks me peaches and pears.

Soeren offers me candy and Cokes,

Soeren listens and laughs at me jokes.

Soeren helps when I get in a fight,

Soeren does all my homework at night.

Soeren misses me,

Soeren cries,

Soeren thinks I'm a wonderful guy.

So if you ask me who's my best friend, in a whiz,

I'll stand up and tell you that Soeren is.

But yesterday night I got quite a scare,

I woke up and Soeren just wasn't there.

I called out and reached out for Soeren's hand,

In the darkness where Soeren usually stands.

Then I poked through the house, in each cranny and nook,

But I found somebody each place that I looked.

I searched till I'm tired, and now with the dawn,

There's no doubt about it-

Soeren's gone!
